How do I return a faulty product?

If you’ve bought a faulty item sold by us on our website, please contact our Customer Service team with your order number, the item(s) being returned, a brief explanation of the fault, and whether you want a refund or replacement. A member of the team will then give you all the details needed to return the faulty item free of charge.
